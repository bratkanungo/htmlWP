      <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.</h5>
      <h1>Definition of HTML</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language. HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.
    Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).
    HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. You might know them as the words between the <angle-brackets>. They allow all the cool stuff like images and tables and stuff, just by telling your browser what to render on the page. Different tags will perform different functions. The tags themselves don’t appear when you view your page through a browser, but their effects do. The simplest tags do nothing more than apply formatting to some text, like this:

<b>These words will be bold</b>, and these will not. </h5>

      <h1>HTML Basic Tags</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt, &lth4&gt, &lth5&gt, and &lth6&gt. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.
      Paragraph tag - The &ltp&gt tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs.
      Line break tag - Whenever you use the &ltbr&gt / element, anything following it starts from the next line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.

The &ltbr /&gt tag has a space between the characters &ltbr&gt and the forward slash. If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward slash character and just use br it is not valid in XHTML. Colors are very important to give a good look and feel to your website. You can specify colors on page level using &ltbody&gt tag or you can set colors for individual tags using bgcolor attribute.

The body tag has following attributes which can be used to set different colors −

    bgcolor − sets a color for the background of the page.

    text − sets a color for the body text.

    alink − sets a color for active links or selected links.

    link − sets a color for linked text.

    vlink − sets a color for visited links − that is, for linked text that you have already clicked on.
</h5>
      <h1>HTML Elements</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash. &ltp&gt....&lt/p&gt is an HTML element, h1.../h1 is another HTML element. There are some HTML elements which don't need to be closed, such as img.../, &lthr&gt / and &ltbr /&gt elements. These are known as void elements.

HTML documents consists of a tree of these elements and they specify how HTML documents should be built, and what kind of content should be placed in what part of an HTML document.</h5>

      <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, paragraph tag &ltp&gt and other tags. We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the HTML tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.

An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value

    The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph p element in the example carries an attribute whose name is align, which you can use to indicate the alignment of paragraph on the page.

    The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations. The below example shows three possible values of align attribute: left, center and right.

Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive. However, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase attributes/attribute values in their HTML 4 recommendation</h5>
